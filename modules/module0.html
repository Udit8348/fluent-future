<!-- TODO: we could benefit from a summary of what these modules are (hint: target the audience) and add some AI generated images (could take inspiration from mock ups in proposal) -->
<!-- TODO: we could benefit from a motivation page that explains why this course is worth doing, this could be a good place for more academic research and ethos to our module -->

        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>Fluent Future is an interactive educational website designed for introductory-
            level language instructors, focusing on utilizing how they can use Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance
            language immersion.
        </p>

        <p>The application of cutting edge technology such as LLMs to this domain was motivated by a decade long study
            completed by the National Center for Education Statistics. They measured a 3.5% year-over-year increase in
            high school students' enrollment in foreign language classes over the last decade. Most notably, Spanish language
            enrollment reached 70% by the last year, while language retention outside the classroom stagnated at 10% (Digest
            of Education Statistics, 2019). The primary goal of these training modules is inform instructors about LLMs and
            how they can use them to augment the teaching experience.

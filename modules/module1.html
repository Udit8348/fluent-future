          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>There are two main types of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models: probabilistic and rule-based AI. LLMs can be built on top of either one of these AI models. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses that are important to consider.</p>

                <h3>Probabilistic AI</h3>
                <p>Probabilistic AI uses its best guess to determine what word comes next. The most popular probabilistic LLM is ChatGPT which you can try for free online (chat.openai.com). Probabilistic models have been designed to output a series of most probable words one at a time, based on a large amount of data that it has been trained on. Since probabilistic models are always giving their best guess, it means they do not fully understand what they are generating. Instead, they are generating content based on patterns they may have seen before without comprehending what they write. This is useful for more enriched and creative output, and allows the LLMs to recognize nuanced human input. However, it is common for probabilistic LLMs to "hallucinate" which is a term that means the LLM starts to build its own beliefs about facts that are simply not true. Below, is one such example is ChatGPT mistakenly thinking there are multiple occurrences of the letter "e" in "mississippi", while understanding a malformed query from the user.</p>

                <h3>Rule-Based AI</h3>
                <p>Rule-Based AI models rely on hard-coded rules to evaluate text. Currently, there are no popular free online LLMs that use a rule-based AI. Typically, if a rule based AI is needed, a custom hybrid model is created that combines a set of rules that have to be enforced and a probabilistic model. This is because instead of guessing the next word based on probability, these models recognize language structures such as grammar rules and formulate responses. They are less prone to hallucinating, however it requires a large undertaking to teach a model all the grammar and language rules. If you have small set of grammar rules you can request the LLM to adhere to those rules. This could be useful for evaluating the correctness of the students' writing automatically.</p>

                <p id="fake-post"><i>User123:</i> I have found that the pros of a probabilistic LLM outweigh the cons! This is because there are a lot of introductory level grammar concepts and guides online so ChatGPT has been trained on a large dataset of them. This makes its guessing very effective!</p>

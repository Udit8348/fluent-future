          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>One of the most important aspects of learning a language is relevant and engaging lessons. While textbooks are filled with lessons, they can become out of date as technology changes. The textbook might be decades old and still portray students exchanging emails as contact info. With LLMs it is easy to generate a reading module that is up to date with modern times</p>

              <h3>Iterative Prompting</h3>
              <p> The goal here is to generate a reading module that highlights the contrast between traditional methods of communication portrayed in outdated textbooks and modern communication methods using email.</p>
                    <p>
                    <p><b><i>Iteration 1: Broad Request</i></b></p>
                    
                      
                    <i>Teacher:</i> "Can you help me create a reading module on current events?"
                    <br> <br>The initial prompt is broad, asking for a reading module without specifying a particular topic.
          
                    <p><b><i>Iteration 2: Topic Selection</i></b></p>
                    <i>Teacher:</i>  "Let's focus on recent developments in renewable energy. Can you create a reading module that covers the latest breakthroughs, challenges, and their impact on the environment?"
                    <br> <br> The user refines the request, specifying the topic of renewable energy and providing some key areas to cover.
            
                    <p><b><i>Iteration 3: Specific Events</i></b></p>
                    <i>Teacher:</i>  "Great! Now, let's delve into specific events, such as the recent international summit on renewable energy. Include details on agreements made, notable speeches, and the implications for global sustainability."
                    <br> <br> The user further refines the request by specifying the focus on a recent international summit on renewable energy.
                    
                    <p><b><i>Iteration 4: Cross-disciplinary Impact</i></b></p>
                    <i>Teacher:</i>  "In addition to the summit, explore how these recent developments in renewable energy intersect with other disciplines, such as economics and policy. Discuss any collaborations or agreements that could shape the future of sustainable practices."
                    <br> <br> The user expands the scope to include cross-disciplinary impact, encouraging a more comprehensive exploration of the topic.
                    <hr>    
                    Through these iterations, the user refines the request, providing more specific details and guidance at each stage. This iterative approach ensures that the reading module is tailored to the user's interests and preferences regarding the coverage of recent events in renewable energy.

                    <i>Teacher:</i> "Develop a reading module on current events, covering a variety of topics that reflect the latest happenings globally. Include a mix of political, economic, social, and environmental events to provide a comprehensive overview. Generate a list of vocabulary students would need to learn before-hand based on the attached list of words that students already know."
                    <hr>
                    <br> With a single specific prompt the teacher is able to generate content for a lesson that is up to date quickly and effectively
